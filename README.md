# hello-world
An essential file to get the ropes on github :)

Hi I finally have the time to learn again without pressure of work so I hope to get to learn python and video/sound editing during the corona virus home_stay, also I'm a guitar beginner for almost 3 years lol and wish to play the recorder at one point.
